		    <p>Michele and I had a cracking time on Sunday, the weather was perfect and Captain Steve made the day for us. Thoroughly recommend this to anyone who just wants to enjoy life to the max. As Rat said to Mole -“Believe me, my young friend, there is nothing - absolutely nothing - half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.”</p>
