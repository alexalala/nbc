          So after nearly 10 years of service, Blue Ice's Moorings were looking a little bit worse for wear and well in need of a rebuild. So we set aside a day, got the necessary equipment and a fantastic team together and got to work!
          <br><br>
          We knew from the start that this was never going to be a small job, but trying to construct a brand new set of moorings in such a marshy, waterlogged environment wasn't easy.
          <br><br>
          However, ten hours off hard labour later and these are the wonderful results!
